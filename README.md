Assignment Task

This task is about Python and SQLAlchemy. First, analyze explore the climate data, and then design my own climate app.

Instructions
1.	Firstly, I was stuck for a long time while writing code related to the latest data up to a year ago, until I finally solved the problem using the knowledge I learned in class.

2.	Secondly, I tried many times, but the time format displayed in the first chart was still different from the example given in the assignment. I tried different methods but still couldn't solve the problem. This will be a focus for my continued learning in the future.


3.	I encountered many difficulties while developing the app. First, I kept getting an error saying that the 'station' was not mapped. I tried for a long time and even sought help from ACS, but I couldn't solve it until I realized that the SQLite path was incorrect. After fixing it, I was able to access the correct webpage. However, later on, I found that the paths for <startdate> and <startdate>/<enddate> weren't displaying properly in the URL. To make it easier to understand and provide hints, I researched and learned the relevant code from online resources, and finally resolved the issue.

Declaration

During the project, I used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others.
